A migrant charity says a person they were in contact with on the boat said it was in distress, but Greek authorities say it repeatedly refused offers of help.<\/p>\n<p>Following are some details from the accounts so far:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Leaving Libya<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Two Greek sources familiar with police inquiries say that, based on accounts from about 30 survivors, the ageing fishing vessel left Tobruk, in Libya, early on 10 June.<\/p>\n<p>Passengers paid $4,500 for passage to Italy, the two Greek sources said. Based on some accounts, there were about 20 women and children among the passengers. They booked their voyage on social media, according to a maritime ministry official.<\/p>\n<p>Traffickers had promised ample room on the vessel, but once passengers arrived at the scheduled departure point and saw it was overcrowded it was impossible to turn back, those sources said.<\/p>\n<div id=\"88530a01-a58e-432d-b543-ad0de961018e\">\n<div class=\"storyCard eyOoS qwBlA\">\n<div class=\"   \n                  story-element\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\">\n<div>\n<p>Over the next few days at sea the boat developed \u201ctwo or three\u201d mechanical faults, which were fixed by a crew of between 8-10 people. Progress was slow.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf people reacted the traffickers would shout and threaten to stop giving them water,\u201d one of the sources said, citing accounts of survivors.<\/p>\n<p>Passengers were also adamant about getting to Italy, which borders visa-free EU member states permitting safe passage, rather than Greece, circled by Balkan states that are taking an increasingly tough line on migration, they said.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"a47d0713-a4b9-4be8-9592-42f643b67bb3\">\n<div class=\"storyCard eyOoS qwBlA\">\n<div class=\"   \n                  story-element\"><\/p>\n<div class=\"story-element story-element-text\">\n<div>\n<p><strong>Mixed Messages<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Advocacy group Alarm Phone, which operates a trans-European network supporting rescue operations, said it received its first call from the boat just after 1200 GMT on 13 June to say the vessel was in distress.
